### Given the root of a binary tree, find the most frequent subtree sum. <br> The subtree sum of a node is the sum of all values under a node, including the node itself.

<br>
For example, given the following tree:

```
  5
 / \
2  -5
```

Return `2` as it occurs twice: <br>
once as the left leaf, and once as the sum of `2 + 5 - 5`.
